# **Bosses:**
## **Mecha Sonic**

Mecha Sonic has a hitbox whose origin X/Y coordinates are shared with Mecha Sonic's X/Y coordinates.  Its width radius is 16, and its height radius is 27.

Mecha Sonic also has 2 damage hitboxes.

The first one is always active, and shares its origin X/Y position with Mecha Sonic's X/Y coordinates.  Its width radius is 12, and its height radius is 12.

The second damage hitbox is only active when Mecha Sonic is stationary.  

Its origin is located at ((X ± (width radius of first hitbox)), (Y ± (height radius of first hitbox))), with the addition or subtraction of the width/height radii depending on Mecha Sonic's orientation.  

This damage hitbox has a width radius of 4, and a height radius is 4.

## **Death Egg Robot**

TODO: Add data, as this is a rather complex boss with lots of hitboxes.
